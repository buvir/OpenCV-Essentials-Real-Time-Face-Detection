# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV + Haar Cascades

## Overview
A simple Python project that uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time using your webcam. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected faces.

Built a real-time face detection app using Haar-Cascade classifiers.

Demonstrates classical computer vision techniques: grayscale conversion, feature extraction, and sliding windows.

Shows understanding of image processing and bounding box detection.

## Features
- Real-time face detection
- Uses Haar Cascade classifier (classical computer vision)
- Demonstrates grayscale conversion, feature extraction, and sliding window detection

How to Run
```
python face_detection.py

```

## Installation
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
